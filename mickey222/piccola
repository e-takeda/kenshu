			PICCOLA

 Once there lived in France a little girl. Her name was Piccola. Her
father was dead and her mother was very very, poor.
 One Christmas Eve Piccola said to her mother, "Will Santa Claus come to
our house tonight?" Her mother looked very sad and shook her head.
 At bedtime Piccola pulled off her little wooden shoes and put them on the
floor near the chimney. she said to her mother, "Perhaps Santa Claus will
come."
 In the night a little bird with a broken wing fell down the chimney and
hopped into one of the shoes.
 Very early in the mornig Piccola woke up. She jumped out of bed and ran to
look into her shoes. There she saw the little bird in one of her shoes.
She picked up the shoe and ran to show her Christmas present to her mother,
and said, "Santa Claus did not forget me."
